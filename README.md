# Medical-Image-Enhancement
common method to enhance some cbct images.

Little project in my internship.<br>
Here are 4 methods in my work: <br>
Histogram Equalization, Gamma/Laplace Transform,
CLAHE and Retinex.<br>

### .ipynb files include 4 ways to enhance the photo and you can see the result.
### .py file is a Functional Interface
you can input a __starting point__ from the photo(1024\*1024), input the __height and the width__ you want,and you can also choose to use one way(clahe or redinex) to enhance the photo.
